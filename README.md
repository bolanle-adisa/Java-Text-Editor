# Java-Text-Editor
Your task is to design a GUI JAVA application with the features below. 
You will be  designing an application that works similarly to NOTEPAD. 
1. All exceptions should be handled and possible user inputs anticipated 
2. Your application will enable a user of your application to view and edit a text file 
3. Users should be able to vertically and horizontally scroll through both documents (Hint: Use  JScrollBar) 
4. When the file is opened, the line numbers for the text in the file will be displayed on the left  hand side of the file 
5. Even line numbers in a file should be displayed with the color blue  while odd numbers in the file  should be displayed with the color black 
6. Upon clicking the menu “FILE” the user should be provided with a dropdown menu as follows: 
a. An option called “New” which creates a new .txt document.  
b. An option called “Open” which opens a .txt document in an available pane.  
c. An option called “Save” which saves all open documents.  
d. An option called “Exit” which saves the open document then closes the application.  (Hint: Use JFileChooser, JMenuBar and JMenu for these tasks) 
7. Upon clicking the word “EDIT” the user should be provided with a dropdown menu as follows: 
a. An option called “Replace” which allows the user to replace a supplied string with  another supplied string in the open document.  
b. An option called “Go to...” which takes the user to a particular line number in the open  document.  
8. Upon clicking the word “FORMAT” the user should be provided with a dropdown menu as  follows: 
a. An option called “Green” which displays all the lines in the open file in the color green.  
b. An option called “Red” which displays all lines in the open file in the color red.  
9. Upon clicking the word “HELP” the user should be provided with a text document explaining all  the options coded into the application. 
10. Submit the JAR file for the application and source code
